### Course Goals
To study the application of digital signal processing to problems in image processing. Topics covered will range from the fundamentals of 2-D signals and systems, to image enhancement, restoration and segmentation. 

### Course Description

The field of Image Processing is concerned with the study of computational approaches for the analysis, storage and interpretation of digital content. In modern times, the sphere of influence of Image Processing has expanded to include an assortment of fields ranging from medical diagnostics to autonomous navigation.
This course provides introduces students to basic concepts and techniques in digital image processing. Topics covered will include characterization and representation of digital images, image enhancement, image restoration, image analysis, and image segmentation.

### Prerequisites

Desired: Introduction to Signal Processing or equivalent, Introduction to Linear Algebra or equivalent.

Required: Ability to program. The homework assignments and the exams will involve substantial amount of programming in MATLAB.

### Time & Place 
Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:00pm-2:20pm CT
ECE420 lecture: All lectures will held live on zoom and linked through canvas. Lectures will also be recorded for those who cannot attend during scheduled class times.

Office hours are replaced with increased Campuswire activity on myside. For coding questions that involve your own code, please make a private thread that is only visibile to TA/Instructor.

If serious problem regarding an assignment arise, I am available for zoom session on an individual basis. However, a requirement for a zoom session is to have an active Campuswire thread.


### Policies 
* *Grading:* Homeworks 1 through 7 are each graded Pass/Fail. Each homework consists of a coding and a technical writeup. Your coding must be correct, and your writeup must be clearly written (see latex template here: ) in order to receive a passing grade. For each assignment that you fail, your grade gets lowered by one letter. So if you pass all seven assignments you get an A, if you fail one assignment you get a B, if you fail two you get a C, and so on. *You can resubmit up to three homework assignments that you received a failing grade for.* We plan to stick closely to these grading guidelines, but some exceptions may be made for partial credit (e.g. A-/B+, etc.). 

* *When and Where to Submit Assignments:*  A latex writeup report for each assignment must be submitted on [Canvas](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/education/login.html) 
by 11:59pm on the due date.  Your code must be pushed to your individual GitHub Classroom code repository, also at 11:59pm on the due date. 

* *Late Policy:*  If EITHER there is nothing on Canvas OR your code has not been pushed to by 11:59pm on the due date, you fail the assignment. The most recent code on github at 11:59pm on the due date is the code we will grade. The most recent submission in Canvas at that point, is the one we grade. A good approach is to continually check in and push to GitHub as you work. Also, put up a "safety" submission on Canvas with what you currently have, an hour prior to the deadline. *You can resubmit up to three homework assignments that you received a failing grade for.*  

* *Cheating & Academic Dishonesty:* Do your own work. This includes free response answers and code. Penalties include failing the class and can be more severe than that. If you have a question about whether something may be considered cheating, ask, prior to submitting your work. We will be checking for code duplication. Academic dishonesty will be dealt with as laid out in the student handbook.

* *Attendance* is not graded.

* *Announcements* and discussions will take place on [CampusWire](https://campuswire.com/p/G45D7003E). You can sign up for the page at that link using the sign-up code 6624.
